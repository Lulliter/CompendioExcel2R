  # contact_policy: >-
  #   E-mail and Slack are the best ways to get in contact with me. I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails and Slack messages within 24 hours (*really*), but also remember that life can be busy and chaotic for everyone (including me!), so if I don't respond right away, don't worry!
